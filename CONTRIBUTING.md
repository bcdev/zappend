## Code style

The `zappend` code compliant to [PEP-8](https://pep8.org/) except for a line 
length of 88 characters as recommended by [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/).
Since black is un-opinionated regarding the order of imports, 
we use the following three import blocks separated by an empty 
line:

1. Python standard library imports, e.g., `os`, `typing`, etc
2. 3rd-party imports, e.g., `xarray`, `zarr`, etc
3. Relative `zappend` module imports using prefix `.`, but 
   avoid `..` prefix.
