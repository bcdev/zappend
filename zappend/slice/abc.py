class SliceSource(ABC):
    """Represents a source for a slice dataset.
    Instances of this class are supposed to be used as context managers.
    The context manager provides the dataset instance by calling the
    [get_dataset()][zappend.slice.abc.SliceSource.get_dataset] method.
    When the context manager exits, the
    [dispose()][zappend.slice.abc.SliceSource.dispose] method
    is called.

    You may implement your own slice source class and define a
    [slice factory][zappend.slice.factory.SliceFactory] function
    that creates instances of your slice source. Such functions can
    be passed input to the [zappend()][zappend.api.zappend] function, usually
    in the form of a
    [closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)) to
    capture slice-specific information.

    The utility functions
    [to_slice_factories()][zappend.slice.factory.to_slice_factories] and
    [to_slice_factory()][zappend.slice.factory.to_slice_factory] ease passing
    slice-specific inputs to your custom slice source.

        ctx: The processing context.
