    A slice source is a disposable source for a slice dataset.

    A slice source object must implement both

    * [get_dataset()][zappend.slice.abc.SliceSource.get_dataset] and.
    * [dispose()][zappend.slice.abc.SliceSource.dispose]

    If your slice source class requires the processing context,
    your class constructor may define a `ctx: Context` as 1st positional
    argument or as keyword argument.

        This method is not intended to be called directly.
